             <h2>Typeface history</h2>

			 <h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>URW DIN is a sans-serif font designed by Volker Schnebel in 1984. The typeface has 48 different styles and 949 glyphs included. Origins of the DIN font, which stands for Deutsches Institut für Normung, come from DIN 1451. Due to its simple design and legibility, it has been used for traffic signage, and can be described as industrial and grotesque. </p>
             
			 <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Interstate is a sans-serif font that was crafted by Tobias Frere-Jones in the 1990s. The Interstate font family is a reinterpretation of Highway Gothic, which has been the official typeface for American highway signage for decades. Its design is based on signage alphabets developed in the late 1940s by Dr. Theodore Forbes, assisted by J.E. Penton and E.E. Radek. Its wide spacing, it is ideal for signage and display usage. </p>

			    
			<h2>Type Usage</h2>

			<h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
            
            <p>URW DIN can be described as professional and easily legible, yet with an air of youthfulness. The font is often used digitally for websites, e-books, and apps on desktop and mobile devices. Notable qualities of the typeface include tall x-height, square-ish bowls, and rectangular tittles. This font has been used for company logos such as DirectTV, Forever 21, and the Italian University for Design.</p>

            <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
            
            <p>The font is used by a number of large organizations in their logotype and branding materials. Notable qualities of the typeface include its heavier regular weight, ovular bowls, “incomplete” descenders, and oblique ends for both ascenders and descenders. Brands using Interstate includes CITI Bank, Southwest Airlines, Soundcloud, and more.</p>

            <h2>Type breakdown</h2>

			<h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
            
            <p>DIN has a Condensed and Semi-Condensed version of the typeface, which allows for a variety of uses. The x-height also lands on the larger side and URW DIN with a regular weight has a neutral thickness. The counters in the a, d, g, and o are a bit on the square side, versus a more rounded typeface. If you look at the ascenders in the d and l, you can also see the top is at 180°, and not slanted. The l also has a terminal at the bottom right. These are some of the main physical attributes of URW DIN.</p>
            
            <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
            
            <p>This typeface has a condensed and a compressed iteration as well. The regular font of the family is on the thicker side and almost looks like a medium weight. It has a similar x-height as URW DIN with it being on the medium to large height. Interstate has round counters and the ascenders appear at a 45° angle. This 45° angle can also be seen reflected in Interstate’s descenders as well. The g also has an interestingly short tail, which makes it stand out from most other typefaces.</p>
            
            <h3>Comparison</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
            
            <p>There are quite a few recognizable differences between URW DIN and Interstate. Some of the most noticeable ones include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interstate has a heavier regular weight than URW DIN</li>
                <li>URW DIN has thinner characters at the same point size</li>
                <li>URW DIN has a taller cap height</li>
                <li>Interstate has a taller x-height</li>
                <li>URW DIN has rectangular titles</li>
                <li>Interstate has angled terminals</li>
                <li>Interstate g has a short tail</li>
                <li>Interstate M has a pointed crotch that slightly descends the baseline</li>

            </ul>
