                                    So, what is Retrofuturism? Simply put, it was a 60s futurism movement that looked at how the imagined future would have looked like for people during and prior to the 1960s (think of it as us looking at people from the past, who are looking back at us, who are from the future, or our present moment).This idea was illustrated through many different mediums such as television, movies, literature, architecture, and more classical forms of art such as drawing.

                                <p>
                                    Futurism was an Italian art movement of the early 20th century, which aimed to capture the dynamism and energy of the modern world in art. Futurists were well versed in the latest developments in science and philosophy and particularly fascinated with aviation and cinematography.

                                    As we entered lockdown in 2020 when venturing out was almost impossible and as a result of not being able to go out and shoot landscapes, we started this series and attempted to create soothing visuals that evoke a sense of quietness and stillness, also to cope with the uncertainty of 2020.

Through a mere swipe, the face filters imagined by the self-styled ‘3D makeup artist’ zaps us into a fantastical future, one where quivering, translucent fins sprout out of cheekbones, and curling lines of liquid metal sketch looping patterns on bare skin.

                                    Most of us think of texture as something you feel when you run your fingers over something. But whether it be a brick wall or a marble countertop, you see surfaces with your eyes before you ever touch them with your hands.

                                   Jell-O, the glistening, jiggling gelatin is a classic dessert, one that, since its inception, has been a mainstay on the tables and in the pantries of typical American families. There were the Jell-O molds, the Jell-O jigglers, the sugar-free Jell-O cups, the savory Jell-O salads and tiered gelatin centerpieces popularized in the mid-century that were mixed with mayonnaise or encased cuts of meat.

                     <p> TREX! That’s the show at Nanazuka 2G, and it features one of Sorayama’s newer fascinations — giant metal dinosaurs of all kinds. There’s a T-rex, a couple raptors, a horny triceratops, a good ol’ stegasaurus, and more. The show also includes some sculptures based on Sorayama’s mecha-saurs — which recently became a motif of Dior high fashion.

                     <p> Call it what you want—liquid metal, chromic graphics, chrometype—but gleaming typography, three-dimensional logos, and textured illustrations are everywhere right now. The look is distinctly computerized: think sinuous, jagged type that’s been plumped by pixels, or water drop squiggles that look like they’ve dripped from a melted lead pipe.

Futurism's graphic revolution did not stop at the page, but encompassed the whole book. In the twenties and thirties, the Futurists' graphic experimentation extended to the form, binding, material and printing technique used for books, which became objects of art in their own right.

When publications first went digital a couple of decades back, their designs more or less aped the print format, in both appearance and navigation, with little adaptation for online. Stories carried the same word length and structure. The potentiality of video and photo galleries had yet to be fully explored. And covers, just like their newsstand-bound counterparts, were largely static.
